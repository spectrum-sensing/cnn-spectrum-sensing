CNN-based binary spectrum sensing using BPSK signals (MATLAB)
This project presents a MATLAB-based implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for spectrum sensing in cognitive radio environments using sinusoidal BPSK signals. The dataset consists of 64×64 grayscale PNG images labeled as either "occupied" (BPSK + noise) or "vacant" (noise only), organized in separate folders. The CNN was trained on 1000 images and achieved a validation accuracy of 85.38%, effectively classifying spectral occupancy. The trained model (trainedNet.mat) is used to predict new test images via prediction.m, producing results with 100% test accuracy. Predicted outputs are saved in predicted_images/ with true and predicted labels, and all predictions are exported to prediction_results.csv. The project includes train_CNN.m for training, and training_summary.png for optional performance visualization. All project files—datasets, code, predictions, and plots—are organized in a folder named work. Reviewers and users can reproduce the results by placing images under dataset/occupied and dataset/vacant, then running the prediction script. This work accompanies the paper titled "Convolution Neural Networks for Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio" by Ahana Chowdhury, Sandhya Pattanayak, Swati Barui, and Sangita Roy from Narula Institute of Technology. The code is intended for academic and research use only.
